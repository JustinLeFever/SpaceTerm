2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks CLK25MHZ_CLK25MHz and CLK25MHZ_CLK25MHz_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks CLK25MHZ_CLK25MHz] -to [get_clocks CLK25MHZ_CLK25MHz_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks CLK25MHZ_CLK25MHz_1 and CLK25MHZ_CLK25MHz are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks CLK25MHZ_CLK25MHz_1] -to [get_clocks CLK25MHZ_CLK25MHz]
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port PS2_CLK direction INPUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port direction. No other driver was expected for the net (PS2_CLK) connected to this Port, but at least one was found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#2 Warning
Port direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port PS2_DATA direction INPUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port direction. No other driver was expected for the net (PS2_DATA) connected to this Port, but at least one was found.
Related violations: <none>
